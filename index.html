        <h2 class="secHeading">ADVENTURE TIME!</h2>
        <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It is a journey or undertaking that is often challenging, and may require courage and determination. The idea of adventure can be applied to a wide range of activities, from physical expeditions to intellectual pursuits.
<br> <br>
As for the "right" adventure time, it can depend on the individual and what type of adventure they are seeking. Some people may prefer to go on an adventure during their free time, while others may make a career out of it. Some people may prefer a more physical adventure like rock climbing or white water rafting, while others may prefer a more intellectual adventure like learning a new skill or exploring a new culture. Ultimately, the right adventure time is when the individual feels ready and able to undertake the adventure they desire.

    <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text">Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport in which a person flies through the air using a paraglider, a free-flying, foot-launched aircraft. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing, which is inflated by the wind to create lift. The wing shape is determined by the suspension lines, which are made of high-strength nylon.
    <br> <br>
    The pilot uses the harness to control the direction and speed of the flight by shifting their body weight. Paragliding can be done solo or in a tandem flight with a trained pilot. It can take place in various locations, including mountains, hills, and coastal areas.

    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which the participant, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or face of a moving wave, typically using a surfboard. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore.
    <br> <br>
    The surfer paddles towards the wave using their arms and then pop up to their feet, using the momentum of the wave to propel them forward. The surfer then navigates the wave, performing various maneuvers and tricks, such as turns and aerial maneuvers, until the wave dissipates. Surfing originated in Polynesian culture, and has since become a popular recreational activity as well as a competitive sport with professional surfers.
